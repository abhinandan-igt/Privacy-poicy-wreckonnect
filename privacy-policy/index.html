    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> July 18, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how Wreckonnect handles your information when you use the Wreckonnect mobile application (the "App").
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the following types of information to enable core functionality:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Personal Information:</strong> Your name, phone number, email address, and (communication history).</li>
      <li><strong>Vehicle Part Requests:</strong> Details such as car model, required parts, and specifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> Only if location is enabled for delivery purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Device model, OS version, and logs for crash reporting.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Facilitate the request and quote process between customers and suppliers.</li>
      <li>Enable clear communication and order tracking.</li>
      <li>Improve our app’s functionality and reliability.</li>
      <li>Support user inquiries and manage account-related requests.</li>
    </ul>

 <h2>3. Payment Methods</h2>
<p>
  Wreckonnect offers three distinct payment methods to accommodate a variety of user preferences:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Account (Offline):</strong> A direct payment arrangement between customers and suppliers. Payment details are shared privately and handled outside the app via bank transfers or cash.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Capricorn (Offline):</strong> A specialized offline payment method used by selected suppliers and customers based on pre-established agreements.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Stripe (Online):</strong> For users who prefer secure digital payments, Wreckonnect integrates with Stripe. All transactions are encrypted and processed through Stripe’s PCI-compliant system. No card or financial information is stored on our servers.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These options ensure flexibility, allowing users to choose the payment method that best suits their needs while maintaining transparency and security.
</p>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or rent your data. We only share your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>With suppliers—to process your vehicle part requests.</li>
      <li>With trusted service providers—to operate and maintain the app.</li>
      <li>When required by law or to protect rights and safety.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use standard security practices to protect your data. While no method is 100% secure, we take all reasonable steps to safeguard your information.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      You may contact us anytime to request access to or deletion of your personal data. We honor all lawful data access requests promptly.
